<p>My Name is Gavin Persaud. I am a 34 year old Guyanese American. I am the second oldest of four siblings. I’m a graduate of The City University of New York College of Technology with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Systems, and also hold a certification in ITIL. Im now in petite of my Masters in Business Information systems. My wife and I live in Newark, NJ and attend Metropolitan Baptist Church, where I’m part of their music ministry and IT ministry. I do enjoy listening to music, traveling, and volunteering. I am currently employed at a financial firm in New York as a Sr. Business Tech Liaison. I’m in my 14th year with the firm. In my current role, I am a ServiceNow (SVN) platform administrator for our Client Technology Solution Division. </p>
<p> I'm a proud member Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. i choose this fraternity because when I did my initial research on Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity Inc, it immediately stood out. Just considering its beginnings on the campus of Cornell University in nineteen hundred and six. This was at a time were many black students on campus were leaving the college, not because of an inability to excel academically, but for the discriminatory treatment administered from white students, faculty and administration. This is where seven young college students realized the need to come together, but for the need of providing a system of survival and support in order to navigate through the difficult campus conditions. These seven amazing men established the first African-American intercollegiate fraternity. They created an organization that would bond men together with the mission of scholastic excellence and community service. Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc has made an impact in education, community service, politics, mentorship, and the lives of countless individuals, including myself.</p>
<p>
Fraternities and Sororities are very necessary. these organizations create bonds that transcends time and space, friendships that lasts a lifetime. One main principle of every fraternity and sorority is a brotherhood or sisterhood that one shares through the good times and provides support during the difficult challenging times that come with being a college student, or even an adult.
